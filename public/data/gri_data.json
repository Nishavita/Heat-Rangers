The North Dakota Apartment Fire left 33 residents without housing. \n\nFor international projects, the local Salvation Army conducts a needs assessment, sometimes independently, and other times in coordination with local government and NGOs. For each of these projects, the Salvation Army verified the number of affected households and the average family sizes. Specifically for Tanzania, the local District Council instituted a registration of households by villages and communities, which was conducted house by house. In Greece, The Salvation Army received their needs assessment in coordination with two local houses of worship. In Tanzania, needs assessments were conducted via community meetings and in partnership with local government.   ",

Entire neighborhoods in the city of Derna disappeared, along with many of their residents, after flood waters from Storm Daniel caused two ageing dams to collapse.\n\nWFP is part of the Libya Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), which brings together local partners and UN agencies, and ensures the quick access needed to provide assistance within 72 hours of a disaster. WFP worked closely with local authorities and United Nations partners. WFP\u2019s planned emergency operation aimed to provide monthly food assistance to 100,000 people in flood-affected areas for three months.\n\nSouth Sudan Context:\nSouth Sudan is simultaneously drowning and drying as the climate crisis tightens its grip. An unprecedented flooding crisis has swallowed large swathes of the country while other parts are grappling with devastating drought.\n\nTwo-thirds of the population \u2013 over 7.7 million people \u2013 are facing crisis or worse levels of hunger. This is the highest number ever, surpassing that seen even at the height of the country\u2019s civil war.\n\nFour consecutive years of record flooding has led to widespread displacement, the destruction of livelihoods and the loss of arable land \u2013 contributing to rising hunger. The effects of these concurrent climate shocks are compounded by rising food and fuel prices and ongoing conflict.\n\nWhile much of WFP's activities are focused on keeping people alive, we are also working with conflict and climate-affected communities to implement long-term solutions to reduce hunger.\n\nWFP urgently needs significant funding over the next 6 months to continue life-saving assistance and invest in long-term resilience-building initiatives. Funding levels for both humanitarian responses and resilience-building are failing to keep pace with rising needs. This means WFP can only provide half rations and must prioritize life-saving assistance for those closest to famine. The UPS Foundation support of this mobilization ensured 12,500 individuals received much-needed food assistance.",

Thanks to this funding, we will help to ensure a legacy of inclusion and belonging at Girl Scouts Nation\u2019s Capital for many years to come. \n\nSince the endowment is in its first year, the number of girls served is challenging to measure at this time, as we have not yet yielded any income to date from this endowment.\n\nMany thanks to The UPS Foundation for your support in building girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place.\n\n*Please note that in the response to the final question in the indicator guidance section, we listed 100% since 100% of the grant funds were used. \n\n*Please note that we track race and ethnicity differently than the categories below. We track race and Hispanic ethnicity separately. Our youth membership demographic information is as follows:\n\n\u2022\t7% self-identify as Asian\n\u2022\t14% self-identify as Black or African American\n\u2022\t0.1% self-identify as Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\n\u2022\t0.2% self-identify as Native American\n\u2022\t4% self-identify as Other Races\n\u2022\t5% self-identify as Multiple Races\n\u2022\t52% self-identify as White\n\u2022\t17% chose not to share their race\n\u2022\t8% self-identify as Hispanic or Latino\n\nThank you!",

To achieve this, the programme adopted a funnel-based approach, addressing digital skills, technology adoption, and economic growth for women entrepreneurs. Activities included technical webinars, in-country workshops, self-paced e-learning courses, and targeted coaching sessions, ensuring a comprehensive and impactful learning journey. As a result, 2,078 participants were directly impacted by these programme activities. Notably, these women entrepreneurs collectively employ 21,042 women, amplifying the programme's reach and creating a significant multiplier effect. The shared knowledge and resources from the programme are being disseminated across these businesses, fostering broader economic empowerment, enhanced digital inclusion, and a ripple effect of growth and opportunity within their communities.\n\nHigh-Level Advocacy and Engagement:\nThe UPS Foundation played a pivotal role in the WTO-ITC High-Level Event on Women and Trade and the SheTrades Summit, held on the margins of the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi, UAE, from February 24 to 25, 2024. This event directly impacted 307 participants from over 70 countries and featured The UPS Foundation in panel discussions on integrating women into the digital and green economy. The events also highlighted the next phase of the programme, underscoring the importance of partnerships in driving gender equality and inclusive growth.\n\nSheTrades Academy:\nThe programme extended its reach through the joint ITC-UPS training modules available on the SheTrades Academy, ITC SheTrades' learning platform, which serves as a UN public good. These modules provided learning opportunities to 830 participants, equipping them with skills and knowledge to advance their businesses and contribute to economic growth.",

    "lives_impacted_methodology":"In Nigeria, the Changemaker Teacher Activation (CTEACH) program has a multifaceted impact, benefiting educators, students, school administrators, families, and the broader community. Each teacher trained in the program directly influences at least five other teachers and 300 students. With a focus on changemaking skills such as conscious empathy for the common good, an open-integrated-fluid team of teams, changemaking leadership, and Changemaking practice. The CTEACH program has successfully trained 158 teachers from 77 low-income schools across the six educational districts of Lagos State, utilizing in-person workshops, a digital learning platform (Thinkific), and ongoing support via WhatsApp and direct phone calls.\n\nIn addition to the students who had direct contact with the trained teachers, the CTEACH program also engaged over 3,000 students through changemaker squads, fostering peer-led initiatives such as waste reuse and recycling programs, climate justice and environmental justice projects,  skill acquisition projects, and community-driven projects. The Digital Literacy and Career Readiness Bootcamp catered to students in Basic 9 who were preparing for Senior Secondary School (high school) and needed to make career-related decisions among pathways in sciences, business, and the arts. The bootcamp was attended by 78 students, who then shared their knowledge with their peers, resulting in an outreach of 1,560 students through the program. Additionally, events like the Idea Pitch-a-thon and the Young Changemakers Festival further expanded the program's reach by providing platforms for more young people to access career enrichment opportunities.\n\nStrategic partnerships with local and international organizations, such as Lantern Books, the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education, Teach for Nigeria, and various government bodies, have enhanced the program\u2019s scale, ensuring that changemaking principles align with national education policies. Innovative resources, including the Changemaking Storybook Series and the Changemaking Index (CMI) digital training materials, have broadened the program\u2019s influence and helped measure its impact by empowering educators and students to incorporate changemaking into their practices and communities. Cumulatively, the CTEACH program has a community of over 10,000 changemakers practicing changemaking and actively involved in creating change in their communities. This is a result of the different programs and activities Ashoka continues to have with and for young people.\n\nIn Addition, 10 Ashoka Young Changemakers who are currently offering different solutions to issues within their community, including but not limited to climate issues, digital literacy, equality, access to education and safe spaces for teenage mothers and rape survivors are elected and currently leading their various initiatives. Once elected, they remain Ashoka Young Changemakers for life and with the help of Ashoka, will continue to accelerate their solutions, deepening impact and creating a better world for all.\n\nOmowumi Ogunrotimi leads the Gender Mobile Initiative (GMI), which focuses on protecting women and girls from sexual and gender-based violence by connecting victims and survivors to comprehensive specialized services. GMI leverages technology, advocates for legal reforms, influences policy, conducts research, raises public awareness, provides preventive education, and promotes legal empowerment to drive systemic change, particularly in cultures and practices that perpetuate gender inequality. With the support of this project, GMI has signed memoranda of understanding with over 110 higher institutions in Africa and has reached more than 100,000 young people this year, including both staff and students. The work of GMI is crucial in addressing sexual and gender-based violence in Nigeria and across Africa, where statistics indicate that 1 in 3 women, 6 in 10 children, and 70% of female undergraduates experience sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\nIn South Africa The CTEACH SA event, held from 8th to 9th May in partnership with Ashoka and EDHE, brought together 137 participants from 21 South African universities to equip them with the skills to integrate changemaker competencies into their teaching and curriculum. The aim was to help educators internalize changemaking practices, enabling them to guide students to become changemakers capable of navigating a rapidly changing world, fostering innovation, and creating economic opportunities. The event also aligned with the EDHE program, which empowers graduates to become job creators, reinforcing the importance of changemaking in shaping students' mindsets and contributing to economic empowerment. \n\nFollowing the event, 47 participants continued their changemaking journey through an online platform, leading to a follow-up online session where they shared how they implemented the learnings in higher education. In August, Ashoka invited workshop facilitators to join the Your Kids ToT (Training of Trainers) program, training nine facilitators from Southern Africa to lead Your Kids workshops for parents and communities. This initiative included 4 members from the Jakes Gerwel Fellowship, 5 from EDHE, 2 from the DG Murray Trust, 2 from E-Cubed, and other aligned organizations such as Activate Leadership and Teach The Nation. The facilitators went on to run multiple trainings in their communities, with some becoming Advanced Facilitators. This ongoing collaboration led to the Department of Higher Education's interest in continuing the conversation, as well as the formation of new strategic partnerships with organizations like E-Cubed (reaching 14,000 schools), the Jakes Gerwel Foundation, and DGM Trust. Additionally, Ashoka was invited to conduct CTEACH SA for E-Cubed's core team of 20 members, strengthening connections with the Department of Education and further advancing changemaking efforts in both higher education and schools across South Africa. Ashoka is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with EDHE to strengthen their partnership. As a result of these conversations, the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two organizations has been extended to three years to formalize and expand their collaborative effort. \n\nUPS also supports the work of Thinkshift- an Ashoka Fellow Organisation. ThinkShift operates at the intersection of educational consultancy and EdTech, focusing on developing and assessing 21st-century skills. In collaboration with partners like UNICEF and BMW, ThinkShift plays a key role in initiatives such as the rollout of the newly gazetted Coding and Robotics subject. The organization\u2019s AI-powered tool measures critical competencies (the \"5Cs\" \u2014 Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity, and Citizenship) through project-based learning activities, converting assessments into digital scorecards to make intangible skills measurable. Currently in its pilot phase, the tool is funded by a development grant from UNICEF and Chery, with plans to enhance its AI capabilities in the future, reduce teacher workloads, and expand its use in resource-limited schools.Job Creation: ThinkShift has created a total of 31 job opportunities this year, comprising 6 full-time core team members and 25 part-time or temporary facilitators engaged in various pilot initiatives. Among these roles, the facilitators have had the most significant impact, as they are directly involved in working with learners, assessing their competencies, and helping scale the reach of our project-based learning programs. \n\nImpact on Learners and Communities: This year, ThinkShift's work has directly impacted 1,000 educators, 90 government officials, and 62,515 learners across South Africa, particularly in coding and robotics. The pilot deployment of our competency-assessment tool reached 750 learners and 25 facilitators in Gauteng. As UNICEF\u2019s Chief of Education highlights in a recent LinkedIn post, 21st-century skills are essential for children\u2019s development and their ability to thrive in a rapidly changing labour market. Although hard skills are easily measurable, assessing 21st-century competencies\u2014given their interconnected nature\u2014has been challenging. ThinkShift\u2019s innovative, AI-powered approach offers a scalable solution for this, marking a significant shift toward competency-based testing in South Africa\u2019s education system. The results from our pilot programs are playing a key role in driving this system-wide change. \n\n\n",

Thanks to the mandatory nature of all activities and the support of local teachers and program managers, we were able to obtain the total number of participants who graduated from the virtual phase. \nFor the on-site component, students underwent a selection process that included interviews to assess their profiles and interests, ensuring a proper match.

    "lives_impacted_methodology":"In cities around the world, the presence of any given tree provides positive impacts that extend beyond the immediate space it inhabits. Thanks to numerous socio-environmental benefits such as air filtration, flood mitigation, enhanced mental and physical health outcomes, increased property value, and natural cooling to help combat urban heat, the presence of trees in highly developed neighborhoods and spaces can improve the lives of residents throughout the surrounding area. By intersecting population data with geolocated project boundaries, we are able to prioritize planting and distribution projects in communities where the benefits of trees would be most felt, and identify the impact of those trees planted.\n\nThe population estimate is derived using an off the shelf geoprocessing tool. The tool works by identifying population overlap with the project boundary, using WorldPop. The tool then takes the percentage of the gridded WorldPop squares that overlaps with the project area and multiplies the square's population by that percentage. E.g., If a WorldPop square has a population of 100 and 30% of it overlaps with the project polygon, then 30 will be added to the population sum for that project. The population fractions from all the overlapping squares are summed for the final result. \n\nHowever, because we developed this methodology in-house and have not had it externally validated\/audited, we are choosing to not include these numbers in this report. The calculation can be run at any time on past domestic projects to highlight the impact of UPS' work, and hopefully on international projects within the near future.",

    "lives_impacted_methodology":"The methodology used to estimate the number of lives positively impacted by our tech training programs is rooted in the Theory of Change framework. This qualitative approach involves mapping out the causal connections between program activities, intermediate outputs, and ultimate outcomes, such as securing tech certifications and employment.\n\nOur tech training programs are strategically designed to fortify each participant's ability to qualify for tech positions by assisting them in obtaining the necessary skills to pass industry-recognized certifications. \n\nThe degree of impact depends on the individual. Program participants can maximize impact by completing all activities, passing all certifications, completing an internship, and ultimately obtaining employment.\n\nA key measure of the positive influence on individuals' lives is reflected in the successful completion of internships in 2024. These internships offer a unique opportunity for individuals to apply their newly acquired tech skills in a professional setting. By immersing themselves in the tech workspace, participants can fully appreciate the value and transformative power of our program.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ve provided two examples of program participants who\u2019s lives were positively impacted by our tech training program;\n\nTech Training Program Participant: Mody\nMody joined the Train and Earn program in October 2023 as a member of our IT Support cohort. At a young age, he was taken out of school to visit Africa and learn about his Muslim faith. He stayed in Africa until 2019. Upon returning to the United States he began working in Marketing. He did well in this field, but after a recent vacation back to Africa, he realized that he wanted to make a change. He wanted to have a successful career working with computers. He also wanted to use his accomplishments as a way to inspire his brother to follow his passions as well. \n\nOnce Mody started our tech training program, Mody worked very hard in his classes, being very consistently punctual in his attendance and meticulous in his coursework. Mody lives by the motto that \u201cif you start something, you need to finish it\u201d, and he has lived up to that, being the first in the class to earn both his Google Professional Certificate in IT Support and his CompTIA A+ certificate. Mody feels like opportunities are presenting themselves for him now that he has earned these certifications. Mody is currently working with us through our Employment strategy, applying and interviewing to secure full-time employment in an entry-level IT Support position.\n\nTech Training Program Participant: Marie\nMarie came to St. Nicks as a job seeker and had previous experience with information technology. Still, due to numerous hardships, she needed support to get her life back on track. During her intake for the program, Marie shared her challenges and expressed her desire to transform her life for a more financially secure future. She was previously homeless during this time and quickly found a shelter to ensure she could prepare for this training. Overall, we recognize that Marie would require substantial support to ensure a positive change in her life. She was referred to us by the Broadway Community Center a few blocks away from the Workforce Development location. \n\nThroughout the training, Marie informed us that the shelter was not a safe environment and that she had to deal with aggressive\/violent people daily. The stipends and MetroCards she was receiving could only help so much. We quickly found her an overnight job, so she could save up for a room to rent. Marie received many referrals including St. Nicks Alliance Housing Department to assist with housing assistance to help get her out of the toxic environment she was living in. Marie\u2019s goals were to find housing and obtain employment in the tech field to ensure financially stable employment and longevity. \n\nWhile Marie was in training, we immediately matched her with a mentor, Mr. Gerace (a Mainframe Application Programming and Systems Support), and referred her to our housing assistance department. Though Marie was not in the ideal circumstances she would like to be in, you can view how each week was helping her build her confidence and slowly her hardships were being resolved. \nMarie completed the Data Analytics Immersive Training and received multiple credentials. During the Job Readiness Curriculum, we updated her resume and cover letter, so she could start applying to employment opportunities before her internship started. Throughout this time, her mentor was also assisting with mock interviews and adding tips for her cover letter.\n\nMarie was set for an internship with an employer partner, Woodhull Hospital, after completing technical training. But a week before she started the internship, she received a job offer from another employer partner, HeartShare. Marie soon started her new position as an IT assistant making $54K including benefits. She recently informed us that she is up for promotion and she is no longer in the shelter and is renting a room. Due to the tremendous amount of support Marie received throughout her time with St. Nicks Alliance, she feels that she can finally breathe and that things will be ok. She continues to show her appreciation for St. Nicks Alliance and shares the work we do within her community. \n",

This figure is 12,500 and is applied to smaller shipments as well.  The second methodology is the measurement we use for our clean birthing kit program. Each kit is designed to impact two lives, the mother and newborn child benefiting from each kit. We combined those figures together to obtain the total represented in this report. ",

The UPS panel presents the case and sets the expectations of what they hope to see in the final presentations. Teams have less than one week to apply leadership theories and skills to develop a recommendation. The case, provided by UPS, investigates financial feasibility and other humanitarian considerations, asking an age-old values question - is this about making money or making the world a better place? This topic challenges students to consider their values in tandem with making recommendations that are best for the organization\u2019s bottom line \u2013 a skill foundational to developing values-based, impact-driven leaders. The teams then have 10 minutes to present and defend their suggestions to the UPS judges. Ultimately, one team is selected as the winner.\nTo date, over 670 students have participated in the UPS Case Study over the last 7 years, curating over 100 presentations that were researched and completed by Leadership Fellows. The UPS case study puts students in a real-world situation to leverage their leadership and business skills while preparing them for scenarios where their job may challenge their core values. The exercise reinforces the importance of values-based, impact-driven leadership.",

    "lives_impacted_methodology":"METHODOLOGY\na. Qualitative\nIn-House: For the cash grant, WFP India M&E team possesses strong qualitative MEL skills, including conducting interviews, focus groups, and participatory observation methods. The team has rich experience in designing and implementing qualitative MEL functions, as do the other WFP Country Offices where UPS funds were allocated.\n\nThird-Party: As per requirement, WFP also engage third-party agencies for specialized qualitative research.\n\nb. Quantitative\nIn-House: Our M&E team has robust quantitative MEL capabilities. It not only performs MEL functions for the WFP internal projects, but it also supports in building MEL capacity of Government departments. Our team is proficient in using statistical and visualization software and tools for quantitative analysis, such as STATA, SPSS, and Tableau.\n\nThird-Party: As per requirement, WFP engages external research firms for large-scale survey implementations requiring specialized expertise and complex statistical analyses. For qualitative research and analysis in the SMART warehouse project, we are collaborating with Indian Grain Storage Management and Research Institute (IGMRI) that is set-up by Government of India for applied research and apex level training in the field of storage and preservation of food grains in the country. The institution is created with a mandate to conduct intensive studies on the problems of handling and storage of wheat, rice, millets, pulses and oilseeds in different agro-climatic zones of the country.\n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT\nEmergency Response: $50K \u2013 Flooding in Niger (August 2024)\nContext: WFP is supporting the Government through the provision of one-month cash transfers to 150,000 flood-affected individuals, complementing the Government's in-kind distributions. This effort aims to alleviate immediate needs and support those left most vulnerable by the disaster.\n\nImpact: A contribution of US $50,000 would enable WFP to provide critical assistance to an additional 3,400 people (approximately) in some of the most affected communities.\n\nDetails: Targeted households would receive one month of emergency cash assistance to secure their families\u2019 immediate food needs. This contribution comes at a critical moment for Niger as the number of people affected by flooding continues to rise as extreme rains persist.\n\nIn-Kind Airlifts: $504,515 \u2013 Supporting Chad and the Central African Republic\nContext: UPS enabled two airlifts for WFP in 2024 \u2013 the first including transportation of 28 MT Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) from Dubai to Ndjamera, Chad for distribution in Sudan to assist individuals for one month within the general food assistance program, and the second being transportation of 16 MT of High-Energy Biscuits from Dubai to Bangui, CAR. This shipment sought to meet nutritional needs for one month as part of the broader food assistance initiative.\n\nImpact: These two airlifts ensured one month of general food assistance for 29,000 people \u2013 16,000 in Sudan and 13,000 in Central African Republic.\n\nDetails: The fair market value of transportation for the Chad airlift was USD 263,337 and USD 241,178 for CAR \u2013 bringing the total to USD 504,515.\n\nCash Grant: $400K \u2013 Smart Warehouses in India\nContext: WFP\u2019s implementation of smart warehouses in India marks a significant step towards mitigating post-harvest storage losses of food grains. These smart warehouses leverage innovative technologies such as IoT sensors and automated systems to monitor temperature, humidity, and pest infestations in real-time, ensuring optimal storage conditions.\n\nImpact: The improved storage management across 4 warehouses will benefit around 1 million beneficiaries served by these warehouses, as well as enhance monitoring and quality\ncontrol of around 54,000 MT food grain, annually. The exact number will be confirmed at the end of the grant period (March 2025).",

This cohort included 15 BIPOC and\/or female small business owners from Fulton, Gwinnett, and Dekalb counties. \n\nFrom September 2024 to February 2025, these business owners participated in monthly workshops on financial education, led by industry experts who provided both a curated curriculum and one-on-one guidance. Thanks to TUPSF's support, each participant received a $1,500 matched stipend for business emergency savings, activated by personally saving $1,500 over the six-month program period.\n\nUpon graduating from BRE, participants will be invited to a pitch competition, offering the chance to secure additional capital through no-cost grants, ranging from $500-$7500, for business growth strategies or asset acquisition.\n",

This data is then recorded into Salesforce regularly, where all internal staff can access it at any time. \n\nBetween April 1, 2024 and November 30, 2024, SBP trained 611 Advise attendees, directly impacted 3,050 lives through projects implemented by the Resilience and Recovery Fellows, assisted 294 individuals via the Disaster Assistance Program, and brought home 14 households via SBP\u2019s Recovery Acceleration Fund. \n\nThe final number reported above (34,342 direct lives impacted) reflects cumulative impact from the start of the grant period through November 30, 2024.\n\nWhile TUPSF does not fund individual Fellows, SBP is reporting on their impact as support from the Foundation has contributed significantly to the oversight, mentorship and training of each Fellow, as well as the innovative planning and execution of this program. Without backing from TUPSF, the transformational impact this program has had and is projected to accomplish in the coming years would not be possible. Impact recorded in the last six months reflects only a few months of impact that ten new Fellows have accomplished, as many were hired in the latter half of 2024. SBP anticipates exponential growth in the impact of this program in 2025, as many Fellow projects that are currently in the planning stage will begin to be fully executed.",

Our selection criteria emphasized a student's positive influence on their school and community. We believe this investment will empower these students to make a lasting impact on their peers, colleagues, and communities.\n\nBy educating and raising expectations for individuals with Down syndrome, we are not only transforming individual lives today but also shifting societal perceptions for a long-term impact. We aim to inspire new parents, medical professionals, educators, and employers to see the potential in these students. When individuals with Down syndrome are empowered with education and job skills, we challenge outdated stereotypes and foster a more inclusive and accepting society.",

These methodologies are implemented in alignment with the parameters outlined in the TUPSF Partner Guidebook to ensure accuracy, consistency, and validity. \n\n1. Measuring Outcomes and Tracking Progress - Regular check-ins with jobseekers form the foundation for monitoring program impact and progression. These check-ins are structured to capture quantitative and qualitative data points, including: \n  a. Number of Job Placements: Tracking the transition of program participants into meaningful employment opportunities. \n  b. Number of People Achieving Career Pathway Milestones: Monitoring incremental achievements, such as completing training modules, gaining promotions, or meeting individual career goals. \n  c. Number of People Receiving Advanced Degrees or Certificates: Documenting educational and professional advancements attained through program support. \n\nThis data is collected and analyzed systematically to evaluate the program\u2019s effectiveness in driving tangible career and educational outcomes for participants. \n\n2. Maintaining Records from Program Activities - Comprehensive record-keeping enables a granular assessment of program reach and service delivery. Key performance metrics include: \n  a. Number of Contacts, Calls, and Appointments: Tracking engagement touchpoints to measure outreach and service delivery scope. \n  b. Number of Wrap-Around Services Provided: Documenting holistic support services, such as housing assistance, financial literacy workshops, and counseling, to evaluate the breadth of participant support. \n  c. Number of Follow-Up Support Instances: Monitoring ongoing participant engagement to assess sustained program impact. \n  d. Number of Intakes and Job Trainees\/Workshop Attendants: Recording new participant enrollments and their participation in skill-building opportunities. \n  e. Number of Events Hosted and Referrals Made: Capturing community engagement initiatives and connections made to external resources. \n  f. Number of Outreach Activities: Quantifying efforts to raise awareness about the program and attract new participants. \n\nThis comprehensive tracking ensures that all program activities contributing to participant outcomes are accurately accounted for in the estimation of lives positively impacted.",

The HOPE Research and Impact Institute (HRII) measures progress by tracking the number of clients that register for HOPE's program offerings as well as which financial empowerment activities clients engage in. HOPE first completes baseline assessments evaluating clients' financial health on many variables. These measurements serve as foundational measures upon which all change is assessed. Some initial baseline measures are financial knowledge, financial confidence, financial stress, spending plans, FICO Scores, debt, savings, banked status, and access to capital. All participation and data gathered is provided at the client\u2019s consent and is reported with client confidentiality and privacy as number one priority.  ",
